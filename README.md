# OD-Attendence-analyer-sender-agent
This project is an agentic AI system using LangGraph that automates daily employee attendance reporting. The agent fetches attendance data from a Google Sheet, generates personalized attendance summaries, and emails each employee their daily attendance status.  This repository is a **public, sanitized version** of an internal HR automation system.
